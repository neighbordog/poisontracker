PoisonTracker
=============

PoisonTracker is a Mod for World of Warcraft. It keeps track of your poisons and reminds you before they run out.


How does it work?
--------------------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When one of your poisons (for example Deadly Poison) ran out or is about to run out, an ability icon of the poison will pop up in the center of your screen.</span>

 

Features
-----------------------------------------------

-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Never bothers you inside cities and rest zones</span>
-   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure when and which poisons should be tracked</span>
